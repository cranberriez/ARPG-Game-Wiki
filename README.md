# ARPG Game Wiki

This is just a stupid side project with a bunch of fake game stuff.

## REACT Built

Project is built in react and largely data driven.

Through this project I'm working through my ability to generate data, format it into various JSON Schema, and represent that data fully in a react application.

So far it's going well with some hurdles and already a lot of things I would do a bit differently next time.

Mainly properly laying out JSON schema a bit earlier. Revisions and modifications in my layered approach to adding specific things have lead to some complications. As well as some odd React.

Chat.gpt 4o was used to generate some of the various "creative" elements of the data, and format it into JSON following my schemas. As well as some weird small functions in the code. Otherwise the project is entirely written by myself.
